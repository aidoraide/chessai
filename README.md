To train the AI you need to download data from [Lichess](https://database.lichess.org/) and place it in the data directory and then run `python train_nnet.py`.

To play versus the AI after it has been trained run `python play_vs_ai_server/play_vs_ai_server.py`. Access the server at `0.0.0.0:9999/`.
